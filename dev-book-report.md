## Reflection
- I find this video interesting because it shows how to make the website responsive not just on widescreens but also on mobile. As a beginner, it's still a bit hard to grasp how to make these adjustments. I made a note to myself to research on media queries after seeing them use it in their CSS. It also gave a little bit of glimpse of what JavaScript is. This video was not too long to watch as well. It's very straightforward, so if you're someone who has no previous knowledge about html or just starting to learn about it, it can be a bit overwhelming because they go through it really fast and there are some things they showed that I don't know yet, and I would want to know but they really don't go in-depth with explanation. 

- I think it might still be fairly relevant because this video was released 2 years ago. Although, I think in the web industry as everything is evolving so fast, 2 years might not be that recent. This might also be irrelevant to the question, but I would also like to point out how they were using Brackets as their text editor, and as far as I know, it has been discontinued in various platforms due to low usage. So some things might already be obsolete if you follow this video (my opinion only).

- I think they are a credible author because they have around 720K subscribers on YouTube, and most of their videos have more that 10K views. This video of them that I watched has about 500K views. I can also see that they still have been regularly uploading videos. They started their channel in 2015.
